Special Notes on using Piwik with Oracle
========================================

This port is currently based on Piwik 1.9.2

Additional Requirements
=======================
- Oracle10/11g (Standard or Express Edition)
- php-oci8 (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/oci8.installation.php)
- Oracle instantclient (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html)

Standard Requirements see also http://piwik.org/docs/requirements/

Setup
=====

1) Add a new Piwik-user, eg. in sqlplus:

 create user piwik profile default identified by passwd                          
                  default tablespace users
                  temporary tablespace temp
                  account unlock;

 grant connect to piwik;
 grant resource to piwik;
 alter user piwik quota unlimited on users;


2) Set these variables for your web environment running piwik:

NLS_DATE_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD' && export NLS_DATE_FORMAT
NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8 && export NLS_LANG
NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF' && export NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT
ORACLE_HOME=/path/to/your/oracle/instant/client && export ORACLE_HOME
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

These parameters are also required in your shell environment, whenever
you use php in CLI-mode, eg. for achiving cronjobs or testing.

If you use phpunit for testing and your installation of PHP uses a separate 
php.ini for running PHP in CLI-mode, make sure your oci8-extension
is loaded in CLI-mode.

Install
=======
The "database name" is the Oracle System ID ("SID") of
your Oracle database instance.
Note: This port of Piwik always uses the long explicit 
Oracle Connect String to ensure Piwik can connect to the 
database even if "Easy Connect String"-support is disabled 
by the DB-Admin.


Limitations
===========
Dbstats-plugin/providing Metadata is currently not supported due to limitation of the oci8-driver


Further Information
===================
see README.md in master branch!

CURRENT TEST STATUS OF PIWIK-ORACLE
***********************************
***********************************

based on Piwik 1.9.2

Results of a "full" run 
(Units, Plugins, Integration)

*****
MySql
*****

Tested also on MySql, boils down to this:

Tests: 3003, Assertions: 10911, Failures: 36, Incomplete: 7, Skipped: 5.



Summary - things that matter most first:


1) Test_Piwik_Integration_PeriodIsRange_DateIsLastN_MetadataAndNormalAPI::testApi
with data sets #0-#11

These 12 tests are failing here, but ALSO failed with an
unpatched "original" Piwik 1.9.2. !!

NOTE: This tests do not (!) fail on Oracle, so I accidentally fixed sth.
that was broken for MySQL. Further investigation required.


2) SegmentTest, multiple failures

About 14 failures, because I had to remove the "AS"-keyword from the FROM-clause,
see example below. A case to adapt the expected files.
"AS" isn't allowed in a FROM-clause Oracle-SQL.

--> Should provide another "expected"-files 


3) ArchiveProcessingTest::testTableInsertBatchIterate/testTableInsertBatchIterateBlob


An Exception is expected, but not thrown    ... 
... the $ignoreWhenDuplicate parameter isn't currently evaluated correctly
in Piwik::tableInsertBatchIterate()/Piwik::tableInsertBatchIterateBlob()


4)  SEOTest::test_API
domain-age expected non-zero rank, got []
Failed asserting that a NULL is not empty.



******
Oracle
******


Tests: 3004, Assertions: 10962, Failures: 73, Incomplete: 8, Skipped: 4.
Taking into account all false positives, it doesn't look much worse
than the MySQL-side.


- 17 are "false positives" due to differently ordered resultsets!
- 14 are "false positives" due to slight changes in the SQL syntax
- 7 EcommerceOrderWithItems-tests fail when run within the complete suite,
-- but don't fail when run "alone" (with phpunit --group ...) 
- 3 failures at least due to obscure precision problem (sums rounded up)
--	so 1243.11 gets 1234
- 5 failures are simply due to wrong filelength of generated html/pdf-reports, 
--	"followups"
- 1 failure because we've got an additional updater file which breaks
--	the ReleaseCheckListTest
- 1 failure because the RankingQuery-feature is not implemented for Oracle
--	and not sure whether all Oracle-dbadmins will be unhappy about this
______
  48


Real failures

- 10 related to the PrivacyManagerTest failing
- 1  related to the obscure failing of the SEOtest (also for MySQL)
- 1  related to strange chars cannot be handled correctly according to
--	Test_Piwik_Integration_TwoVisitsWithCustomVariables_SegmentContains
--	sth. like "pageTitle=@*_)%"
- 3  failed UrlTests
and a few more (will be updated)


Summary - things that matter most first:


0) Test_Piwik_Integration_EcommerceOrderWithItems::testApi 

Data sets #0-#6 fails, but not if that test is run "isolated" 
with "--group EcommerceOrderWithItems", then everything is fine

--> I don't have any idea about this at the moment !!


Data sets #12,#13,#15 fails:
11 cts./precision seems to be missing
in returned values,
eg. "revenue" is calculated to sum up to 
13351 instead of 
13351.11

#25 fails because of different orderding of xml-elements,
the values and xml-elements are identical!

Fails due to wrong order of XML-elements, should provide another "expected"-files 

#28 #29 fails because generated html/pdf-files don't 
have the expected length (cannot be, because of failures
with the data sets #12,#13,#15



1) PrivacyManagerTest, multiple failures

Could trace it back to Piwik_PrivacyManager_LogDataPurger::insertActionsToKeep(),
nothing is inserted into the temporary table because the log-tables seem to 
be empty at this stage. So later everything gets "purged".
No idea yet why these tables in the MySQL-test are NOT empty at this point, 
the Oracle-tables are.

A functional test on the PrivacyManager's web-interface was successful, so this
seems to be working, though the test fails.



2) SEOTest::test_API

Got this, didn't investigate it yet, it also fails on MySql !!! 

"domain-age expected non-zero rank, got []
Failed asserting that a NULL is not empty."



3) IS FIXED ... ArchiveProcessingTest::testTableInsertBatchIterate

An Exception is expected, but not thrown    ... 
... the $ignoreWhenDuplicate parameter isn't currently evaluated correctly
in Piwik::tableInsertBatchIterate()



4) ReleaseCheckListTest::testSvnKeywords
Fails due to an additional updaterfile (1.8.4-ora-b1.php)



5) SegmentTest, multiple failures

About 14 failures, because I had to remove the "AS"-keyword from the FROM-clause,
see example below. A case to adapt the expected files.
"AS" isn't allowed in a FROM-clause Oracle-SQL.

--> Should provide another "expected"-files
